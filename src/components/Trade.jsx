      <h2>üì¶ Trade in Pakistan</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>üì¶ Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Trade is a key driver of Pakistan‚Äôs economy, shaping jobs, income, and
          foreign reserves. Exports bring in valuable foreign exchange, while
          imports meet the demand for goods that the country cannot produce
          locally, such as fuel, machinery, and technology. A balanced trade
          system strengthens economic growth, reduces dependency, and improves
          living standards. By tracking exports, imports, and the trade balance,
          we can better understand Pakistan‚Äôs economic health and its position
          in the global market.

        <h3>üìä Key Trade Indicators</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            To assess Pakistan's trade performance, we focus on several key
            indicators:
          </p>
          <ul>
            {headings.map((h, index) => {
              return (
                <li key={index}>
                  <h4
                    onClick={() => handleHeadingClick(index)}
                    style={{
                      textDecoration: open[index] ? 'underline' : 'none'
                    }}
                  >
                    <span
                      style={{
                        transition: "transform 0.3s ease",
                        transform: open[index]
                          ? 'rotate(90deg)'
                          : 'rotate(0deg)'
                      }}
                    >
                      ‚ñ∫
                    </span>
                    {h.title}
                  </h4>
                  <div>
                    {open[index] && <Details code={h.code} p={h.desc} />}
                  </div>
                </li>
              )
            })}
          </ul>
          <p>
            These metrics provide insights into how much Pakistan trades
            relative to its economy, the value of goods exchanged, and the
            overall trade balance.

        <h3>üåê Pakistan's Trade Partners</h3>
        <p>
          Pakistan's main trade partners include China, the United States, the
          United Arab Emirates, and the European Union. These relationships are
          crucial for both exports and imports, influencing economic stability
          and growth. Understanding these partnerships helps in analyzing trade
          patterns and potential areas for expansion.
