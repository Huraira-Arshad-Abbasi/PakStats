        <p>
          A growing economy creates jobs, increases incomes, and improves living
          standards for ordinary citizens. Pakistanâ€™s economic growth is shaped
          by investments, productivity, and trade. By monitoring GDP growth, per
          capita income, and sectoral contributions, we can understand whether
          the economy is expanding in a healthy and inclusive way, and how it
          compares to other developing nations.
